## Workflow Philosophy

Our workflow is built on these principles:

### 🎯 Interface-First Design
> "Define interfaces before implementation"

**Why**: Prevents breaking changes, enables parallel work

**How**: Phase 6 in workflow - Update protobuf/APIs first

### 🧪 Test-Driven Development
> "Write tests before code"

**Why**: Ensures correctness, enables refactoring, documents behavior

**How**: Phase 8 in workflow - RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle

### 🔄 Multi-Repo Coordination
> "Plan across repos, work with dependencies in mind"

**Why**: 9 repositories must work together harmoniously

**How**: Phase 3-5 in workflow - Dependency analysis and branch management

### 📚 Documentation as Code
> "Documentation is not optional"

**Why**: Future you (and your team) will thank you

**How**: Phase 12 in workflow - Update docs before PRs

### 🔒 Security by Default
> "Security is not an afterthought"

**Why**: Production-grade code from day one

**How**: Phase 11 in workflow - Security scans and audits

## Workflow Metrics

Track these metrics to improve productivity:

| Metric | Target | How to Measure |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| Session Planning Time | < 30 min | Checklist sections 1-5 |
| Time to First Test | < 15 min | From coding start to first test run |
| Test Pass Rate | > 95% | CI/CD dashboards |
| PR Creation Time | < 30 min | From code complete to PR submitted |
| Documentation Completeness | 100% | Checklist section 15 |
| Security Scan Pass | 100% | GitHub Actions |

## Comparison with Other Workflows

### vs. GitFlow
- **GitFlow**: Branching strategy only
- **Our Workflow**: Full development lifecycle (planning → deployment)
- **Integration**: Our Phase 4 uses GitFlow-style branching

### vs. Scrum
- **Scrum**: Agile project management framework
- **Our Workflow**: Technical execution within sprints
- **Integration**: Each session = 1 task, multiple tasks = 1 sprint

### vs. DevOps Pipeline
- **DevOps**: CI/CD automation focus
- **Our Workflow**: Developer actions + automation
- **Integration**: Our Phase 11 (security) and Phase 13 (verification) map to pipeline stages

## FAQ

### Q: Do I need to follow every step every time?
**A**: No. Use judgment:
- Small bug fix: Simplified path (skip interface design, new service setup)
- New feature: Follow most steps
- Emergency hotfix: Focus on Phase 8-11 (implement, test, security, docs)

### Q: What if I'm blocked on a step?
**A**:
1. Document blocker in TODO.md
2. Move to parallel work if possible
3. Escalate to team lead if critical
4. Update session summary with blocker

### Q: Can I work on multiple repos in parallel?
**A**: Yes, if no dependencies:
- Check Phase 5: Cross-repo dependencies
- Use separate terminal tabs
- Track progress in checklist for each repo

### Q: How do I handle breaking changes?
**A**:
1. Phase 6: Design new interface (v2)
2. Keep old interface (v1) temporarily
3. Deprecate v1 with migration guide
4. Remove v1 after grace period
5. Document in CHANGELOG.md

### Q: What if tests fail repeatedly?
**A**:
1. Don't skip tests - fix the issue
2. Break problem into smaller pieces
3. Add more granular tests
4. Pair program if stuck
5. Commit working state frequently

### Q: How detailed should TODO.md be?
**A**:
- Epic level: High-level features (TODO-MASTER.md)
- Repo level: Specific tasks with acceptance criteria (repo TODO.md)
- Task level: Checklist items you can complete in 1-2 hours
