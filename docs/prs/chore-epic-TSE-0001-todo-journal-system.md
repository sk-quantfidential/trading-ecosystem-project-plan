# Pull Request: TSE-0001 - TODO Journal System Implementation

**Branch:** `chore/epic-TSE-0001-todo-journal-system`
**Base:** `main`
**Epic:** TSE-0001 - Foundation Services & Infrastructure
**Type:** Chore (Process Improvement)
**Status:** ✅ Ready for Review

---

## Summary

This PR implements a TODO journal system across all repositories to archive completed milestones and keep TODO files focused on active and future work. The system includes:

1. **TODO-HISTORY-MASTER.md** - Archive of completed epics and milestones
2. **Updated TODO-MASTER.md** - Reference to history file, focus on active work
3. **Removed TODO.md** - Redundant file (project-plan only needs TODO-MASTER.md for coordination)
4. **Fixed create-pr.sh** - Script now correctly matches PR files with branch names (slash → dash conversion)

---

## Problem Statement

### Issue 1: TODO Files Growing Too Large

TODO-MASTER.md has grown to 1,591 lines with completed milestones mixed with active work, making it difficult to:
- Find current active tasks
- Understand what's in progress vs. completed
- Navigate the file efficiently
- Maintain focus on future work

### Issue 2: Duplicate TODO Files

project-plan had both TODO.md and TODO-MASTER.md:
- TODO.md (927 bytes) - Minimal redirect file
- TODO-MASTER.md (76KB) - Actual coordination file
- Confusion about which file to update
- Redundant maintenance

### Issue 3: create-pr.sh Branch Matching Bug

The create-pr.sh script had a bug matching branch names to PR documentation files:
- Branch: `feature/epic-TSE-0002-network-topology`
- Script looked for: `docs/prs/feature/epic-TSE-0002-network-topology.md` ❌
- Actual file: `docs/prs/feature-epic-TSE-0002-network-topology.md` (slash → dash)
- Result: Script failed to find PR docs automatically

---

## Solution

### TODO Journal System Pattern

**Philosophy**: "Keep TODO files for active work, archive completed work in history"

**Structure**:
```
Repository Root/
├── TODO-MASTER.md           # Active and future work only
├── TODO-HISTORY-MASTER.md   # Archive of completed milestones
└── docs/prs/                # PR documentation
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ **Focused TODO**: Only active/future work visible
- ✅ **Historical Record**: Completed work preserved with context
- ✅ **Easy Navigation**: Smaller files, faster to scan
- ✅ **Clear Status**: Separation between done and todo
- ✅ **Consistent Pattern**: Same structure across all repos

---

## What Changed

### 1. Created TODO-HISTORY-MASTER.md

**Purpose**: Archive completed epics and milestones

**Structure**:
- Organized by epic (TSE-0002, TSE-0001)
- Completion dates and duration
- Key achievements and statistics
- BDD acceptance criteria (validated ✅)
- Summary statistics at end

**Content Moved**:
- **Epic TSE-0002**: All 10 completed milestones
  - Connect Protocol implementations (Go and Python)
  - Network Topology Visualization (Backend + UI)
  - Configuration generation and loading

- **Epic TSE-0001 Foundation Phase**: 11 completed milestones
  - Infrastructure Foundation (1a, 1b, 1c)
  - Protocol Buffer Integration (TSE-0001.2)
  - Core Infrastructure Setup (TSE-0001.3a)
  - gRPC Integration (TSE-0001.3b, 3c)
  - Data Adapters (TSE-0001.4 + 7 sub-milestones)
  - Multi-Instance Infrastructure (TSE-0001.12.0, 12.0b)

**Size**: ~400 lines of archived completed work

###2. Updated TODO-MASTER.md

**Changes**:
- Added reference header: "**Note**: Completed milestones are archived in [TODO-HISTORY-MASTER.md](TODO-HISTORY-MASTER.md)"
- Kept all active and future work
- Maintained structure for in-progress epics

**Rationale**: Keep focus on what's next while preserving access to history

### 3. Removed TODO.md

**Reason**: Redundant file - project-plan repository is for coordination, not component implementation

**Before**:
- TODO.md (927 bytes) - Simple redirect to TODO-MASTER.md
- TODO-MASTER.md (76KB) - Actual coordination content

**After**:
- TODO-MASTER.md only - Clear single source of truth

### 4. Fixed create-pr.sh Script

**Bug**: Script didn't handle slash-to-dash conversion for PR file matching

**Fix** (lines 67-73 in create-pr.sh):
```bash
# Try with slashes converted to dashes (common PR file naming convention)
if [[ -z "$PR_DOC" ]]; then
  BRANCH_WITH_DASHES="${BRANCH//\//-}"
  if [[ -f "docs/prs/${BRANCH_WITH_DASHES}.md" ]]; then
    PR_DOC="docs/prs/${BRANCH_WITH_DASHES}.md"
  fi
fi
```

**Testing**: Verified in protobuf-schemas with branch `feature/epic-TSE-0002-network-topology`:
```bash
✅ Found PR documentation: docs/prs/feature-epic-TSE-0002-network-topology.md
```

## Rollout Plan

This PR serves as the **template** for rolling out the TODO journal system to all 9 repositories:

### Repositories Affected:
1. ✅ project-plan (this PR - template)
2. ⏭️ audit-correlator-go
3. ⏭️ custodian-simulator-go
4. ⏭️ exchange-simulator-go
5. ⏭️ market-data-simulator-go
6. ⏭️ orchestrator-docker
7. ⏭️ protobuf-schemas
8. ⏭️ risk-monitor-py
9. ⏭️ trading-system-engine-py

### Per-Repository Changes:
- Create `TODO-HISTORY.md` (component-specific name)
- Update `TODO.md` with history reference
- Move completed milestones to history
- Update create-pr.sh (already done in all repos)
- Create PR documentation
- Commit changes

---

## Pattern for Component Repositories

**File Naming**:
- Component repos: `TODO.md` + `TODO-HISTORY.md`
- Project plan: `TODO-MASTER.md` + `TODO-HISTORY-MASTER.md`

**TODO.md Header Pattern**:
```markdown
# {Component-Name} - Component TODO

**Note**: Completed milestones are archived in [TODO-HISTORY.md](TODO-HISTORY.md)

---

## Current Milestone: {Active Milestone}
[Active work only]

## Upcoming Milestones
[Future planned work]
```

**TODO-HISTORY.md Pattern**:
```markdown
# {Component-Name} - Component TODO History

Archive of completed milestones and major accomplishments.

## How to Use This File
- Completed milestones moved here from TODO.md when 100% done
- Organized by epic for easy reference
- Active work stays in TODO.md

---

## Epic {XXX}: {Name}
[Completed milestone details]
```

---

## Testing

### Verification Steps:

1. **TODO-HISTORY-MASTER.md exists and is organized by epic** ✅
2. **TODO-MASTER.md has history reference header** ✅
3. **TODO.md removed (no longer needed)** ✅
4. **create-pr.sh finds PR docs correctly** ✅

### Manual Testing:

```bash
# Verify history file structure
cat TODO-HISTORY-MASTER.md | grep "^## Epic"
# Output: Epic TSE-0002, Epic TSE-0001

# Verify TODO-MASTER reference
head -5 TODO-MASTER.md
# Output shows: "Note: Completed milestones are archived..."

# Test create-pr.sh (in protobuf-schemas)
bash scripts/create-pr.sh
# Output: ✅ Found PR documentation: docs/prs/feature-epic-TSE-0002-network-topology.md
```

## Benefits

### For Developers:
- ✅ **Faster navigation**: Smaller TODO files, easier to find active work
- ✅ **Clear status**: Obvious separation between done and todo
- ✅ **Historical context**: Completed work preserved with full details
- ✅ **Consistent pattern**: Same structure across all repositories

### For Project Management:
- ✅ **Progress tracking**: Easy to see what's been accomplished
- ✅ **Velocity metrics**: Count completed milestones by epic/timeframe
- ✅ **Retrospectives**: Historical record for reviews
- ✅ **Onboarding**: New team members can see project evolution

### For Maintenance:
- ✅ **Reduced clutter**: TODO files stay manageable size
- ✅ **Better git diffs**: Changes to active work don't pollute diffs with old milestones
- ✅ **Easier merges**: Less conflict potential in smaller TODO files
- ✅ **Clear separation**: Done vs. todo is unambiguous

---

## Breaking Changes

None - this is purely organizational/documentation change.

---

## Migration Impact

### For This PR (project-plan):
- TODO-MASTER.md still contains all the same information
- Completed milestones moved to TODO-HISTORY-MASTER.md
- TODO.md removed (was redundant redirect)

### For Future PRs (component repos):
- Each repo will get similar treatment
- Component TODO.md files will be cleaned up
- TODO-HISTORY.md will archive completed work

---

## Success Criteria

✅ TODO-MASTER.md updated with history reference
✅ TODO.md removed (redundant for project-plan)
✅ create-pr.sh bug fixed (slash → dash conversion)
✅ All changes documented in PR
✅ Pattern established for rollout to other 8 repositories
