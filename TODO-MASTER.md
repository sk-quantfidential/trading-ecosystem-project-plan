## Implementation Principles

1. **Start Simple**: Core functionality only, extensible architecture
2. **Docker First**: All services containerized from day one
3. **BDD Driven**: Every milestone includes behavioral acceptance criteria
4. **Clean Architecture**: Separation of concerns, testable business logic
5. **Production/Audit Separation**: Risk Monitor sees only production APIs
6. **Observable**: Metrics, logging, and tracing built-in
7. **Fail Fast**: Comprehensive error handling and validation

---

## Next Actions

1. Begin with Infrastructure Foundation (TSE-0001.1a, 1b, 1c in parallel)
2. Implement protobuf integration (TSE-0001.2) to enable communication
3. Establish infrastructure and service integration (TSE-0001.3a, 3b, 3c)
4. Build core services in parallel (TSE-0001.4-10)
5. Add observability infrastructure (TSE-0001.11a-c)
6. Complete integration testing (TSE-0001.12a-d)
