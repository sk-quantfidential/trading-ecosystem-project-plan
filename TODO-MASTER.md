#### Milestone TSE-0001.12.0b: Prometheus Metrics (Clean Architecture)
**Status**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** (2025-10-10) - All three Python services complete!
**Components**: risk-monitor-py ‚úÖ, trading-system-engine-py ‚úÖ, test-coordinator-py ‚úÖ
**Goal**: Add Prometheus metrics using Clean Architecture (port/adapter pattern) to enable future OpenTelemetry migration

**Completed Services**:

- [x] Implemented PrometheusMetricsAdapter in infrastructure layer
- [x] Created RED metrics middleware (Rate, Errors, Duration)
- [x] Implemented /api/v1/metrics endpoint
- [x] Added 19 comprehensive tests (8 domain + 11 adapter)
- [x] Integrated with main application via dependency injection
- [x] Validated Clean Architecture compliance
- [x] Created PR documentation
- [x] All 131 tests passing (112 existing + 19 new)

**test-coordinator-py** - ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** (2025-10-10):
- [x] Created MetricsPort interface in domain layer (zero infrastructure deps)
- [x] Implemented PrometheusMetricsAdapter in infrastructure layer
- [x] Created RED metrics middleware (Rate, Errors, Duration)

- [x] Integrated with main application via dependency injection
- [x] Validated Clean Architecture compliance
- [x] Created PR documentation
- [x] All 180 tests passing (161 existing + 19 new)

**Architecture Pattern**:
- **Domain Layer**: MetricsPort protocol (what metrics are needed)
- **Infrastructure Layer**: PrometheusMetricsAdapter (how to collect with Prometheus)
- **Presentation Layer**: RED middleware + /metrics endpoint (uses port abstraction)
- **Future Migration**: Swap PrometheusAdapter for OpenTelemetryAdapter without changing other layers

**RED Pattern Metrics**:
- **Rate**: `http_requests_total` counter
- **Errors**: `http_request_errors_total` counter (4xx/5xx)
- **Duration**: `http_request_duration_seconds` histogram

**Labels (Low Cardinality)**:
- Constant: service, instance, version
- Per-request: method, route, code

**BDD Acceptance**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - All three Python services (risk-monitor-py, trading-system-engine-py, test-coordinator-py) expose /metrics endpoints with RED pattern metrics using Clean Architecture. Future OpenTelemetry migration requires only adapter changes.

**Dependencies**: TSE-0001.12.0 (Multi-Instance Infrastructure Foundation)

**Pattern Consistency**: Follows audit-correlator-go metrics pattern (port/adapter architecture)
